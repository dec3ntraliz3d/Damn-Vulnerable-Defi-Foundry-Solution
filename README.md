### Tips and tricks ‚ú®

- In all challenges you must use the account called attacker. In Forge, you can use the [cheat code](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry/tree/master/forge#cheat-codes) `prank` or `startPrank`.
- To code the solutions, you may need to refer to [Forge docs](https://onbjerg.github.io/foundry-book/forge/index.html).
- In some cases, you may need to code and deploy custom smart contracts.

### Preinstalled dependencies

`ds-test` for testing, `forge-std` for better cheatcode UX, and `openzeppelin-contracts` for contract implementations.
